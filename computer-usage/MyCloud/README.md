This takes some tricks. My current 6TB MyCloud device is running a Linux distro which I don't know: "Linux WDMyCloud 3.10.39 #1 SMP Thu Nov 15 21:22:21 CST 2018 2014T20p4 Build-git0451941 armv7l GNU/Linux"

## Installing packages
Download the package from the web. Then extract the package:
```bash
ar -x $MYPKG
tar -xzf data.tar.gz # 
```
