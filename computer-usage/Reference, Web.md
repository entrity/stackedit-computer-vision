## Lightweight Web Servers

### Flask (Python)

### python -m http.server
Start up a simple http file server in an instant with:
```bash
python -m http.server [port]
```
It defaults to port 8000 and the current directory. It will serve up directories as index pages.

### Google Apps
Instead of running your own server, create a Google Apps Script project: https://script.google.com

When ready to deploy, click Publish > Deploy as web app. Then complete the form and submit.

The "Current web app url" with look like this:
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzN5c9IV0MEgSwaCTo1T3dyYqanfwSBpCbrxyT9WKD2IwB9hE5w/exec
Copy the link that says "Test web app for your [latest code](https://script.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/macros/s/AKfycbxkYMBUOozVsEq4h7RxyPf3rznHHJXksyxzvcgqgSjM/dev)."
https://script.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/macros/s/AKfycbxkYMBUOozVsEq4h7RxyPf3rznHHJXksyxzvcgqgSjM/dev
Use this one, and you won't have to keep deploying
