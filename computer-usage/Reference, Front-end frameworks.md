### Thinking in React
1. Break the UI into a component heirarchy, matching the data architecture/model
2. Build a static version in React (*no state*; renders data but has no interactivity)
	- bottom-up in bigger projects, building tests as you go; top-down in smaller projects
3. Figure out a DRY state design
