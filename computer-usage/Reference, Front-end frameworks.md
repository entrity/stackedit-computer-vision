### Thinking in React
1. Break the UI into a component heirarchy, matching the data architecture/model
2. Build a static version in React (*no state*; renders data but has no interactivity)
	- bottom-up in bigger projects, building tests as you go; top-down in smaller projects
3. Figure out a DRY state needs (assign data to state or props)
4. Assign state variables to React components
5. Add inverse data flow (for "lifted up" state)

### Formik

For use with React. (Recommended in the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).)
