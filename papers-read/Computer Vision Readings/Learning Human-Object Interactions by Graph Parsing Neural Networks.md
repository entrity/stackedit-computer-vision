# [Learning Human-Object Interactions by Graph Parsing Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07962.pdf)

**Problem:** human-object interaction recognition requires 

**Proposal:** Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) to represent HOI structures with graph and then parse optimal graph structures.

## Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN)
Generalization of Message Passing Neural Network.

Design motivations: (1) unify learning capability of NN with power of graphical representations. (2) apply to diverse tasks in both static and dynamic (video) scenes.
