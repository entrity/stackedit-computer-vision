## Findings
1. Semantic analysis of individual units in neural nets is unlikely to contain semantic information. (Not sure how they got this; didn't see support in their discussion.)
2. Neural networks are unstable against small changes to their inputs. They coin **"adversarial examples"** for perturbed images.

Traditional computer vision systems (like HOG) allow "one to inspect the individual coordinates of the fea
