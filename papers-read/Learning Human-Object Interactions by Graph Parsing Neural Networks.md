# [Learning Human-Object Interactions by Graph Parsing Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07962.pdf)

**Problem:** human-object interaction recognition requires 

**Proposal:** Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) to represent HOI structures with graph and then parse optimal graph structures.
