# [On Implicit Filter Level Sparsity in Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12495.pdf)

Related to 'dying ReLU' phenomenon, in which some features get cut off in training. Causes reduced learning capacity of network. LeakyReLU and RandomOut propose symptomatic fixes.

Proposal: this emergency of sparsity is result of disproportionate influence of regularizer (L2 or weight decay) viz the gradients in training.

- Increases mini-batch size decreases sparsity
- adaptive gradient descent method increase sparsity
- L2 synergizes with adaptive gradient descent more than weight decay does to increase sparsity

Said sparsity can be leveraged for speedup, eliminating the need for explicit pruning. Can remove 70-80% of filters from VGG-16 on CIFAR10/100.

Learning tasks in isolation ignores useful relationships. Model aware of relationships requires less supervision and computation (than multiple models, one for each task).

> Unlike multi-task learning, we explicitly model the relations among tasks and extract a meta-structure.

# [Object Discovery in Videos as Foreground Motion Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02772.pdf)

BG: Motion segmentation methods aim to segment moving objects in video, can discover new (unseen) objects (as opposed to object detection and object tracking in video, which train for specific categories).

Plan: formulate object discovery problem as foreground motion clusterin: cluster pixels in a video into different objects based on their motion.

Video frames and optical flow as input to encoder-decoder, then use feature embeddings to learn classifier to discriminate foreground v background.

Bottom line: Object detection. E2e: a single convnet predicts bbs and class probabilities for those bbs.
Benefits: Speedup over divided models like the original R-CNN. Speedup over sliding window models like Deformable Parts Model (DPM). Better mAP.
