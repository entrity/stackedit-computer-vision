# [From 3D Scene Geometry to Human Workspace](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abhinavg/affordances/)

**Task**: human-centric understanding of scene. Use "affordances," defined as opportunities for physical interactions.

Given a scene, predict all possible actions that are consistent with the scene geometry. Use poses instead of semantic categories like "sittable" or "touchable."

Aim: generalize to unseen poses (e

Working with indoor scenes. Scene geometry is represented as voxel-based Manhattan world.
