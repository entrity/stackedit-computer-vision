# Visual Relationship Detection with Language Priors

Stanford. Cewu Lu, Ranjay Krishna, Michael Bernstei, Li Fei-Fei

Use triplet $(obj_1,pred, obj_2)$ to denote relationships.

*Problem*: skew of rare relationships because relationships are combinatorial. Need to learn with relatively few examples, then. Contrast with [6], which required enough training examples for every possible triplet.
*Proposal*: learn appearance of objects
