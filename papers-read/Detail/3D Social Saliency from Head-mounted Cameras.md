# [3D Social Saliency from Head-mounted Cameras](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hyunsoop/nips/NIPS12.pdf)

**Bottom line**: present a method to reconstruct a 3D social saliency field and localize 3D gaze concurrences from videos taken by head-mounted cameras on multiple people.

Improving scene understanding by seeing where multiple people in the scene are gazing (social saliency).

## Method
Reconstruct 3D from video using "structure from motion."
Camera pose is recovered using a RANSAC embedded Perspective-$n$-Point algorithm.
