# Actor and Observer: Joint Modeling of First and Third-Person Videos

**Task**: egocentric action understanding
**Problem**: lack of aligned 1st-person and 3rd-person video data

## Contributions

1. New dataset: **Charades-Ego**. 157 activity classes, 4000 video pairs (31.2 seconds long on avg)
2. New model: **ActionObserverNet**: aligns the two domains by learning a joint embedding in a weakly-supervised setting

Difficulty with datasets:
1. Most datasets are lab-collected and lack diversity, containing on a few subjects.
1. 

Theory of mind says humans can put selves in another's shoes. This is done from egocentric perspective.
