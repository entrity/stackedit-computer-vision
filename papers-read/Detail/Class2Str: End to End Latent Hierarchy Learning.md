# Class2Str: End to End Latent Hierarchy Learning
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06675.pdf

**Predecessor**: Most similar is HD-CNN. Yan et al. first train a fine grained classifier and then use the confusion matrix to identify some coarse grained categories. A separate fine grained classifier is trained for each of these coarse grained categories to improve the accuracy. Thus, HD-CNN discovers a 2 level hierarchy with a 2 stage training process, while we discover a multilevel hierarchy using a single stage end to end training.
