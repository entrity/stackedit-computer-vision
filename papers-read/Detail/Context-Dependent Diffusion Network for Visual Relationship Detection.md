# [Context-Dependent Diffusion Network for Visual Relationship Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06213)

**Problem** visual relationship detection
**Proposal** word semantic graph and visual scene graph, are constructed to encode global context interdependency

## Contributions
- context-dependent diffusion network (CDDN)
## Related Work
- Early on, simple relationships only (spatial predicates) or human-object interaction
- Two categories: joint model (triplets form classes) v separate model (predicates form classes)
- Joint models don't scale because of long-tail distribution of triplets, combinatorial quantity
