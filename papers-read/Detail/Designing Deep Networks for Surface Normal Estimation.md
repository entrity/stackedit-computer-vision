# [Designing Deep Networks for Surface Normal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4958)

Use CNN to estimate surface normals from an image. Make use of 

Follow the work of Eigen [5] who used CNN to predict depth in image. Frame it as a regression problem. Coarse-level architecture predicts coarse depth; fine-level architecture predicts fine depth.
