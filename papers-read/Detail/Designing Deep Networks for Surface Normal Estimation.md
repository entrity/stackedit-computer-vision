# [Designing Deep Networks for Surface Normal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4958)

Use CNN to estimate surface normals from an image. Make use of recent decades' traditional work on 3D scene understanding.

Follow the work of Eigen [5] who used CNN to predict depth in image. Frame it as a regression problem. Coarse-level architecture predicts coarse depth; fine-level architecture predicts fine depth.

## Themes from scene understanding

1. Fuse top-down, bottom-up

. Human-centric constraints
