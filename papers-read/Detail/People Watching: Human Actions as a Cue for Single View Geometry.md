# [People Watching: Human Actions as a Cue for Single View Geometry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4958.pdf)

Treat each person in scene as an "active sensor" to get information about the 3D geometry of the scene, using Gibson's notion of *affordances*.

**Challenges**: (1) humans don't densely explore the scene; (2) quality of 3D pose estimation

limited to indoor scene
still images and time-lapse video

detect humans
infer poses
use imferred poses t to extract functional regioms in the image, eg sittable surface
use functional surfacess to estimate geoetric comstraits om
