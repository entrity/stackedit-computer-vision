# Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Networks

2017. Carlini & Wagner. UC Berkeley 

**Bottom Line** Present the C&W attack(s).
- overcame defensive distillation, a formerly effective measure
- Found advx on 100% of images
- new SOTA
- required less distortion

2 approaches to evaluating robustness of net (against attack):
(1) prove a lower bound (harder)
(2) construct attacks that demonstrate an upper bound

**Datasets**: MNIST, CIFAR 10, Imagenet
