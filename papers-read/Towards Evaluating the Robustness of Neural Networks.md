# Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Neural Networks

2017. Carlini & Wagner. UC Berkeley 

**Bottom Line** Present the C&W attack(s).
- Found advx on 100% of images
- new SOTA

2 approaches to evaluating robustness of net (against attack):
(1) prove a lower bound (harder)
(2) construct attacks that demonstrate an upper bound
